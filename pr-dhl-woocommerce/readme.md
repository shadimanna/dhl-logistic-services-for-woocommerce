Automate e-commerce orders with Official DHL for WooCommerce. Covers DHL Paket and Deutsche Post International.

== Description ==

DHL’s official extension for WooCommerce on WordPress. Manage your national and international shipments easily. The “DHL for WooCommerce” – plugin is compatible with the following DHL service offerings depending on your origin country:

* DHL Paket (Germany)
* Deutsche Post International (all European countries)


The following DHL services are no longer supported by this plugin:

* DHL eCommerce Asia (TH, MY): Please use instead the following plugin [here]( https://wordpress.org/plugins/dhl-ecommerce-apac/ ).
* DHL Parcel for WooCommerce (for online stores that ship orders from the Benelux region): Please use instead the following plugin [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dhlpwc/).

== Features ==

1. NEW: Ship your orders with **DHL Warenpost International** in Germany.
2. Fast and easy **label creation** of your national and international orders with DHL products such as DHL Paket, Warenpost, DHL Paket International and Warenpost International
3. Automatically receive a **tracking code** for each label.
4. Use **additional delivery services** as e.g. the visual check of age available via the API of DHL Paket or Cash on delivery
5. Offer **Preferred Delivery Options** to your customers via “Wunschzustellung”. The customer has the opportunity to select a specific date for his delivery or an alternative delivery location e.g. a drop-off location or his preferred neighbour.
6. **Customization** Enable/disable or edit the names of services and set up the handling cost for each DHL shipping service.
7. Experience **premium support**, timely compatibility updates and bug fixes.
8. The “**print only if codeable**” – option you can activate in the DHL settings will check whether the address is correct or not before generating the label.
9. **Bulk Label Creation** allows you to create multiple DHL Labels at once.
10. **Return Parcel Handling** allows you to print a return label with a “return address” so your customer can return the shipment easily.


== Availability by countries and prerequisites ==

Based on your sender country and shipping preference, different access credentials for **DHL Paket, DHL Parcel NL and Deutsche Post International** are required for the configuration:

3. Go to WooCommerce–>Settings->Shipping and select the upper DHL unit (depending on your home country this is DHL Paket, DHL (Parcel) for WooCommerce or Deutsche Post) to configure the plugin.
